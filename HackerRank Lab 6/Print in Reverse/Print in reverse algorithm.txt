firstline - number of test cases

secondline (first line of the first test case) - number of elements in the first test case = n1
third line (second line of the first test case) - first element of the first test case
(n1+2)th line (last line of the first test case) - last element of the first test case

(n1+3)th line (first line of the second test case - number of elements in the second test case = n2
(n1+4)th line (second line of the second test case) - first element of the second test case
(n1+n2+2)th line (last line of the second test case) - last element of the second test case
